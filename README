AppSales allows iPhone developers to download and analyze their daily and weekly sales reports from iTunes Connect.

The newest reports can be downloaded with a single tap and all numbers are automatically converted to your (selectable) local currency.

With clear bar charts you'll get a quick daily overview of how your apps are doing in the store. For each report you can view percentages of countries and each of your product's share of the revenue.
